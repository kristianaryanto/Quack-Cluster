    # - **David (Chicago): $1225.00**
    # - **Eve (Los Angeles): $150.00**
    # - **Frank (Chicago): $1200.00**

    # ---

    #### 2. `high_value_users` (CTE2) results (`total_spent > 450`):

    # - **Alice (New York), $1725.00, 'Premium'**
    # - **Charlie (New York), $1575.00, 'Premium'**
    # - **David (Chicago), $1225.00, 'Premium'**
    # - **Frank (Chicago), $1200.00, 'Premium'**

    #   - **Eve (Los Angeles), $150.00, 'Standard'**
