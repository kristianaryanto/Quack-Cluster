## üöÄ Getting Started with Development

To get your local development environment running, you'll need Docker and `make`.

### 1\. Fork & Clone

First, fork the repository to your own GitHub account. Then, clone your fork locally:

```bash
# Replace 'your-username' with your GitHub username
git clone https://github.com/your-username/quack-cluster.git
cd quack-cluster
```

### 2\. Setup the Environment

The following commands will generate sample data and launch the cluster using Docker.

```bash
# 1. Build your container first
make build

# 2. Generate sample parquet files in the ./data directory
make data

# 3. Build and launch the cluster with 2 worker nodes
make up scale=2
```

Once the containers are running, you can monitor the cluster status via the **Ray Dashboard** at `http://localhost:8265`.

### 3\. Development Commands

The `Makefile` contains several useful commands for managing your development environment:

| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `make up scale=N` | Starts all containers with `N` worker nodes (default: 1). |
| `make down` | Stops and removes running containers safely. |
| `make logs` | Tails the logs from all running services in real-time. |
| `make build` | Rebuilds the Docker images if you change a `Dockerfile`. |
| `make test` | Runs the `pytest` suite inside the `ray-head` container. |
| `make clean` | **DANGER:** Stops containers and deletes all associated volumes. |
